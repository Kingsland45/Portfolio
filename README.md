# VirtualServerProject
A Linux Server VM running on VirtualBoxVM leveraging the Openstack Cloud to Create Web Servers Using QCow2 Ubuntu image. 

This system can be used for many things, but the key aspects are that it is relatively light, portable, free, effective, 
and has great customer and community support.

This is a backend project, following it can give a great starting point for businesses who want to build their own server or simply 
provide valuable education on a broad range of computer science server creation topics. It allows for cloud 
infrustucture and server creation in a controlled and safe environment. 

If there are ever any issues, the VM can revert to saved states or outright get deleted without affecting the host system. 

Technology used: VirtualBox, Linux Server, Openstack, Apache, MariaDB, SSH, Nano, RSA encryption.

# Iris deep learning script
In this project, I aimed to demonstrate computer science and machine learning skills by building, 
evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning models using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of 
iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. 
The primary goal was to classify the species of iris flowers based on these measurements.

Technology Used: Python, Machine Learning Algorithms

# Runge-Kutta Damped Oscillator
In this project, I implemented the Runge-Kutta method to solve a damped harmonic oscillator problem. 
The solution was then visualized using Python's matplotlib library. This project showcases my skills in numerical methods, 
Python programming, and data visualization.

Technology used: C++, Python, G++, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numerical Methods.

# Java Sorting Comparisions
In this Java program I implement several sorting algorithms on a random array of integers, comparing the sort times in 
nanoseconds.

# Final Note
Research and all work done by Austin Kingsland.
