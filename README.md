# Professional Voxmox Server (2026 Build)
A Voxmox VE server cluster acting as host for a professional web-hosting environment. With this state-of-the-art build we are able to maintain 99.9% uptime on our server, use vitual machines, Cloudflared tunnels with Wireguard to increase our security, maintain full compliance, create backups and screenshots, load balance, and ultimately create our own cloud environment.

This is a professional, scalable design that can be implemented on everything from home labs to modern data centers. Following the step-by-step guide results in a complete and secure Proxmox host server running a virtual Ubuntu webserver that serves docker container applications over an encrypted cloudflared tunnel. It also includes a Traefik reverse proxy, Aginx, crowdsec, Fail2ban, a full back-end and much more. This is the ultimate guide to modern web backend development. 

# Professional Touch-Screen Kiosk for Employee Scheduling (2025 Build)
This Python project developed by me is currently used by hundreds of employees in a professional logistics corporation (Kroger contracted client). This allows the floor workers to easily and convieniently sign up for extra work on one of our touvhscreen kiosk, all while keeping the control and monitoring in the hands of managers (Admins). This has eliminated countless work hours, cut down our cost, and made the scheduling process a breeze. This is my most feature rich and complete Python project to date and features a beatifure and intuitive GUI for both the admin panel and the employee touchscreen. Data management is key in this application, and it can run flawlessly for an unlimited amount of time thanks to automatic data cleaning features. This is an industrial level application that is currently in use by one of the biggest and most vital companies in America today, Kroger. 

# Virtual Ubuntu Server Project (2024 Build)
A Linux Server VM running on VirtualBoxVM leveraging the Openstack Cloud to Create Web Servers Using QCow2 Ubuntu image. 

This system can be used for many things, but the key aspects are that it is relatively light, portable, free, effective, 
and has great customer and community support.

This is a backend project, following it can give a great starting point for businesses who want to build their own server or simply 
provide valuable education on a broad range of computer science server creation topics. It allows for cloud 
infrustucture and server creation in a controlled and safe environment. However, for a professional and secure build, see my "Professional Voxmox Server" project. 

If there are ever any issues, the VM can revert to saved states or outright get deleted without affecting the host system. 

Technology used: VirtualBox, Linux Server, Openstack, Apache, MariaDB, SSH, Nano, RSA encryption.

# Python Invoicing Automation Project
The Invoice Automation System is a robust tool designed to streamline the invoicing process for small businesses. 
I developed this system for use in a professional company, where it saves employees countless hours by automating the generation and emailing of invoices. 
The system automatically creates professional PDF invoices customized with client details and billing information, then seamlessly emails them to clients and
supporting multiple recipients per client.

It also includes a customer management feature for adding, editing, and deleting customer records, with all data securely stored in
CSV format for easy persistence and backup. To ensure security, sensitive email credentials are encrypted and securely stored. 
Built with a user-friendly Tkinter-based GUI, the system is accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. 

This automation has significantly reduced the time spent on administrative tasks, allowing me to focus on growing my business 
while minimizing errors and ensuring timely invoicing.

# Iris deep learning script
In this project, I aimed to demonstrate computer science and machine learning skills by building, 
evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning models using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of 
iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. 
The primary goal was to classify the species of iris flowers based on these measurements.

Technology Used: Python, Machine Learning Algorithms

# Runge-Kutta Damped Oscillator
In this project, I implemented the Runge-Kutta method to solve a damped harmonic oscillator problem. 
The solution was then visualized using Python's matplotlib library. This project showcases my skills in numerical methods, 
Python programming, and data visualization.

Technology used: C++, Python, G++, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numerical Methods.

# Java Sorting Comparisions
In this Java program I implement several sorting algorithms on a random array of integers, comparing the sort times in 
nanoseconds.

Technology used: Java

# People Management System (Program.vb file)
In this VB.NET Program I demonstrate object oriented design within the .NET framework. The program includes exception handling, 
File I/O, Permanent data retention via local CSV File, and a user interface.

Technology used: VB.NET, .dontnet
