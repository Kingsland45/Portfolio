# VirtualServerProject
A Linux Server VM running on VirtualBoxVM leveraging the Openstack Cloud to Create Web Servers Using QCow2 Ubuntu image. 

This system can be used for many things, but the key aspects are that it is relatively light, portable, free, effective, 
and has great customer and community support.

This is a backend project, following it can give a great starting point for businesses who want to build their own server or simply provide valuable education on a broad range of 
computer science server creation topics. It allows for cloud infrustucture and server creation in a controlled and safe environment. 
If there are ever any big issues, the VM can revert to saved states or outright get deleted without affecting the host system. 

Research and all work done by Austin Kingsland.
Technology used: VirtualBox, Linux Server, Openstack, Apache, MariaDB, SSH, Nano, RSA encryption.

# Iris deep learning script
In this project, I aimed to demonstrate computer science and machine learning skills by building, 
evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning models using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. 
The primary goal was to classify the species of iris flowers based on these measurements.
